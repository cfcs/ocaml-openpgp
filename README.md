OpenPGP library (RFC 4880) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cfcs/ocaml-openpgp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cfcs/ocaml-openpgp)
===========================================

This library implements rudimentary support for OpenPGP as used with signatures,
and has basic support for decryption of messages.

__Right now it's a work in progress and should not be used for anything critical to security in a real-world situation.__

- Supporting El-Gamal and elliptic curve keys are out of scope due to lack of support for these in [mirage-crypto-pk](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto).

I could be persuaded to add these if someone can point me to maintained libraries implementing these.

### Contributing

Contributions are greatly appreciated!

To prevent duplication/collision of work, please consider leaving a note in the [issues section](https://github.com/cfcs/ocaml-openpgp/issues/) before implementing large changes.

The library and API is still a volatile as it is still being developed.

Suggestions for things to improve:
- Writing more tests, for example for primitives in `types.ml`.
  - Tests for vulnerabilities that have affected other OpenPGP implementations.
  - Tests pertaining to diverse/"exotic" keys
- Adding useful debug output, or extending existing pretty-printers with more information.
- Suggestions / signatures for a better API, or scenarios that the library should support.
- CLI commands or arguments (this is one of my first times using `cmdliner` - I'm sure things can be improved)
- Performance improvements

### Building

The library currently depends on the unreleased `Usane` library for unsigned
 arithmetic, and on my unreleased wrappers around `Cstruct`, called `cs`.

```bash
opam pin add -n usane 'https://github.com/hannesm/usane.git'
opam pin add -n cs 'https://github.com/cfcs/ocaml-cs.git'
opam pin add -n gmap 'https://github.com/hannesm/gmap.git'
opam pin add -n mrmime -k git https://github.com/oklm-wsh/MrMime.git
opam install alcotest bos cmdliner cs cstruct fmt fpath gmap hex logs \
             mirage-crypto-pk ptime qcheck rresult usane topkg mrmime
ocaml pkg/pkg.ml build
```

### Roadmap

- Consider support for inline signatures
- ~~GPG-agent protocol~~ the GPG-agent protocol is inherently unsafe for
  signing operations. Other projects (`git`, `qubes`, `enigmail`) seem to
  implement GnuPG integration by shelling out to the `gpg` cli.
  Some limited compatibility with that seems more useful to implement.
- [Git signing / verification](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work), see [section below](#git--openpgp-integration)
- MirageOS version of [Qubes split-gpg](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-app-linux-split-gpg)

### Cmdline usage

The library ships with a sample application in `app/opgp.ml`.

**Usage details is available with `opgp --help`.**

Examples of how to use the application are also given there.

It can currently:
- `opgp genkey`: Generate a (DSA | RSA) private key with subkeys for
  signing+encryption
- `opgp sign`: Produce a detached signature on a file
- `opgp convert`: Derive a public key from a private key
- `opgp verify`: Verify a detached signature
- `opgp list-packets`: List packets contained in armored or binary PGP streams
- `opgp decrypt`: Decrypt messages to RSA keys
  - Decompress ZIP(RFC1951) and ZLIB messages - BZip2 is still missing
- `opgp encrypt`: Encrypt messages to RSA keys
- `opgp mail-decrypt`: Carve out PGP/MIME messages and decrypt them. Currently does not check signatures.

### Git / OpenPGP integration

`git` integrates cryptographic signature creation and verification by
calling out to `gpg`.
Peter Todd has a nice article about that in the
[documentation for his OpenTimeStamps project](https://github.com/opentimestamps/opentimestamps-client/blob/master/doc/git-integration.md)
(which is a separate project that combines `gpg`-signatures with
date proofs using append-only logs like BitCoin).

A _minimally **GnuPG**-compatible_ program `opgp-git` is provided with
the `ocaml-openpgp` distribution to replace the use of `gpg` in this scenario.
- **NB: At the moment only verification is supported,** and only against a
  single public key contained in `~/opgp-git.asc` - as thus this is not super
  useful, but is there as an example, and to remind me to fix the API to
  support some sort of PKI / key database.

To activate it, you will have to change the `gpg.program` variable to
point to `opgp-git` instead of `gpg`:

```shell
$ git config --global gpg.program "$(opam config var openpgp:bin)/opgp-git"
```

- **NOTE** that `opgp-git` **does not** implement the full GnuPG command-line
interface, it merely implements the handling of the functionality
expected by `git`, namely `["opgp-git", "--verify", "$file", "-"]` and
`["opgp-git", "-bsau", "$key"]`.
See the `gpg.program` entry in `man git-config` for more details.

Once configured, you can "manually" sign commits at commit-time with
`git commit --gpg-sign=KEYID`, or you can configure git to do this automatically
(see the `commit.gpgSign` entry in `man git-config` for more details).

- To retrieve the purported PGP key for a Github account, you can add `.gpg` to
the end of their URL. Example: https://github.com/rootkovska.gpg
