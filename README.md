OpenPGP library (RFC 4880)
--------------------------

This library implements rudimentary support for OpenPGP.

Right now it's a WiP. The first goal is to implement signature verification / generation (encryption is out of scope for now).

### Resources

The spec is included in this repository in the rfc/ subdirectory.
