(* This is an implementation of OpenPGP's CFB mode.
   Note that OpenPGP has their own homegrown version; this is not
   textbook CFB.

   [finalize_decryption] takes care of checking the "MDC"
   ( SHA1 hash of:
   - "IV" (the [block_size] bytes that prefixes the plaintext)
   - the "quick check" (which we just randomly generate)
   - the plaintext
   - the [mdc_header] (two bytes, see below).
